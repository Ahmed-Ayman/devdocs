# Overview

> NOTE: The development of this tutorial is currently IN PROGRESS. A more complete rough draft is available in the How Tos section here: [How to develop a new content type](docs/how-to/how-to-develop-new-content-type.md). When this tutorial is complete, it will replace the equivalent How To.

Out of the box, Page Builder comes with several content types (controls) that you can drag onto the stage to build your storefront pages, as shown below. In this topic, you will learn how to create your own content type for use within Page Builder.

## Prerequisites
{:.tutorial-before}

Page Builder creates content types from modules. So this topic assumes you have a basic module structure in which to add your content type files.

## Overview

An overview of the steps for creating a Page Builder content type are briefly illustrated and described here.

![Creating Custom Content Types](../images/content-type-overview.png)

1. **Add configuration**: an XML file to setup all the other files that control the appearances and behaviors of your content type.  
2. **Add templates**: HTML files that define the appearance of your content types on the Admin stage (preview.html) and the storefront (master.html).
3. **Add component**: a JavaScript file that define the behavior of your content type on the Admin stage (preview.js) and the storefront (master.js).
4. **Add form (editor)**: a UI component (XML file) to give users the ability to add or edit content using your content type.
5. **Add layout**: an XML file to add your form editor to the stage. 
6. **Add styles and icons**: LESS and image files (png, svg) to add specific styling and images to your content types as they appear on the Admin stage and the storefront. 
7. **Add frontend widget**: a JavaScript file to control the UI behavior (user interactivity) of your content type on the storefront.  

## Content type files

The files you will need to create in order to build a basic content type are shown here.

This tutorial walks you through creating these files, starting with [Step 1: Add configuration](step-1-add-configuration.md).
