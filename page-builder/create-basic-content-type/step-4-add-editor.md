# Step 4: Add editor

The editor for your content type requires two files: a UI component form and a simple layout. The editor slides out from the right of the screen within the Admin UI to give users a way to customize your content type. Add these files to your module in the following locations:
 - `view/adminhtml/web/layout/`
 - `view/adminhtml/web/ui-component/`
