# Introduction

PageBuilder is a module that provides a visual way to build content within the Admin editor for Magento 2.3 and above.
It replaces the default WYSIWYG Editor in the Admin area with a highly configurable drag-and-drop editing system.

[This page will introduce Page Builder by providing infographics, screenshots, and descriptions for what Page Builder is and how it works.]
